    <p>Hello world! My name is Joshua Glant, I am a fifth-year student at University of Washington, Seattle campus. I am majoring in Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management (ESRM) through the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences. My particular focus is on botany and horticulture – I am a big plant nerd! I enjoy going out in nature to observe plants, birds, insects and all parts of the natural world. I also have a huge plant collection at home, both indoors and outdoors! I also enjoy drawing and painting, especially botanical and ornithological illustration, though I haven’t practiced in a while. Save a cow, eat more chicken!

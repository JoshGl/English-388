    <p>Cows, also known as cattle, are members of the species <em>Bos taurus</em>, in the mammal family <em>Bovidae</em>. Cows are even-toed ruminants, meaning that their hooves are 
    cloven, and that they obtain nutrients from plant material through a specialized digestive process which involves fermentation and repeated chewing.  
    Cows are surprisingly intelligent, and very important throughout human civilization, both culturally and economically. Cows are used not only for their
    meat and dairy, but also to create important materials such as leather and gelatin.</p>
